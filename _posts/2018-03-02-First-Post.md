Welcome to my site.  On this site you will find my semi-regular research roundup, occasional blog posts, and my beta or fully active development projects.
My goal is to make the hard stuff easier for teachers, this means summarizing research and writing programs that might be helpful,
especially to teachers of students with disabilities and ELLs. 

My first project is up, it is called the Extended time calculator.  This project is in beta, if you have feedback please contact me and let me know.
