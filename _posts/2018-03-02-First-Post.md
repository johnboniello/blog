title: My first project The Extended Time Calculator
---

My first project is up, it is called the Extended time calculator.  This project is in beta, if you have feedback please contact me and let me know.

This project was inspired by my colleague Ann, who asked if it would be possible to create an app that helps teachers calculate the extended time a student with a disability may need. We orininally attempted this with excel, but could not figure out how to make it expandable and distribute it without the need for excel on a computer.  Also, people are uncomfortable with excel. I decided to take on the challenge and try to learn python again.

It has been about 5 years since I first tried to learn python.  Back then I didn't have a project to work on or a reason to learn it.  I finally had a tangible project and decided I would give it a try.  After about 3 weeks and learning a lot about python, Qt, and packaging for windows, I now have a fully functioning program. 

Unfortunately this only works on windows at the moment, but soon I hope to get it going on mac. 

My ultimate goal is to make it a webapp, I'm thinking of using Django for that, but that requires even more learning!
